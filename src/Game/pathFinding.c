/*
How it works:
findPath-
  Rather than have each enemy store a path (some enemies may need different 
  paths than others) for them to follow, I realized it would be easier to simply
  have each grid point to the adjacent grid that is closest to the exit, then
  the enemies just follow these 'arrows'. Findpath finds these 'arrows' by
  starting at the tile next to the exit, and then iterating out to its adjacent
  tiles and having them point back to the tile before them until every
  unoccupied tile has an 'arrow'
  
  Big O notation is O(n) (iterates through each grid tile once)
  time to find optimal path to exit from every tile on a grid of 4,000,000 tiles: ~650 milliseconds
  A quicksort of 4,000,000 integers on the same computer took ~1060 milliseconds
